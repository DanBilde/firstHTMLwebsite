                Red, red wine
                Goes to my head
                Makes me forget that I
                Still need her so
                
                Red, red wine
                It`s up to you
                All I can do I`ve done
                memories won`t go
                memories won`t go
                
                I just thought that with time
                Thoughts of you would leave my head
                I was wrong, now I find
                Just one thing makes me forget
                
                Red, red wine
                Stay close to me
                Don`t let me be in love
                It`s tearin` apart
                My blue, blue heart
                
                I just thought that with time
                Thoughts of you would leave my head
                I was wrong now I find
                Just one thing makes me forget
                
                Red, red wine
                Stay close to me
                Don't let me be in love
                It's tearin' apart
                My blue, blue heart
